# Calcination Analysis

Prototype for machine learning supported calcination analysis.

## Notebook 1:
Cleaning of calcination data and creation and comparison of different
machine learning regressors approximating the reactivity **t60** value.

## Notebook 2:
Experimental setup to find a better experiment representation than the **t60** value with:

1.  Single experiment approximation with a sigmodial curve.

2.  Experimental set approximation with a quadratic plane.

Visualization of received curve parameters and comparison.

------------
The project is in an unfinished state. The models are not industrially usable, but show new ways of modeling the reactivity in the future to make better predictions.

- The curve/plane fit function must be formulated in a better way
- More data needs to be introduced
- Existing errors in the data need to be fixed
